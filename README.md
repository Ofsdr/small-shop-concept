# small-shop-concept
A small mini-store where I practice laying out product cards and creating a simple structure like an online showcase. There is a header, search, product grid and a basic footer, like regular e-commerce sites. The project was created simply for practice, to practice the arrangement of elements and work with the store layout.

i want to make the store more attractive
